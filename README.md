# Traffic Crashes Analysis üöóüí•

## A Data Science Approach to Chicago Traffic Accidents

## Project Overview

This project leverages data science techniques to analyze traffic crash patterns in Chicago, with the ultimate goal of predicting whether an accident will result in injuries. By understanding the factors that contribute to more severe accidents, this research aims to inform road safety initiatives and potentially save lives.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Wrangling üìä
- Extraction of data from Chicago Open Data Portal
- Cleaning and preprocessing of raw traffic crash information
- Integration of multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç
- Temporal analysis of accident patterns (time of day, day of week, seasonal trends)
- Geographical mapping of accident hotspots
- Correlation analysis between various factors and accident severity
- Statistical analysis of contributing factors

### 3. Machine Learning Models ü§ñ
- Supervised learning approach to predict injury occurrence in traffic accidents
- Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of accident severity
- Model performance evaluation and optimization
- Insights for practical application of predictions
